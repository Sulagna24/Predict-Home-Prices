## Predict-Home-Prices

# Problem Statement
In the real estate market, determining the fair price of a house is often complex. However, there's a clear correlation between a houseâ€™s size and its price. The aim of this project is to simplify this challenge by using Linear Regression to create a model that can predict house prices based on their size.

# Project Goals
- Load and explore a housing dataset

- Clean and prepare data for analysis

- Apply Linear Regression to predict housing prices

- Visualize the results for better interpretation

- Evaluate the model performance using real-world data

# Features
- Simple & Clean Code: Easy to read and beginner-friendly

- Data Exploration: Use of pandas to inspect and understand the dataset

- Machine Learning: Implements Linear Regression with scikit-learn

- Visual Analysis: Includes plots showing prediction vs actual prices

- Real-World Data: Works with a CSV dataset mimicking real home data

# Conclusion
This project helped me understand the real-world application of Linear Regression in the housing industry. Through this notebook, I practiced working with data, visualizing relationships, and building predictive models using Python.
