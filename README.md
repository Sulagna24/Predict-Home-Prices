## 📌 Project Overview

In this project, I used a dataset containing house sizes and prices to train a **Linear Regression model** that predicts the price of a house based on its size. 

The aim was to:
- Understand the relationship between house size and price
- Build a predictive model using simple regression
- Visualize the data and regression line
- Evaluate model accuracy using common performance metrics

This project helped strengthen my understanding of data preprocessing, regression modeling, and Python libraries used in data analysis.
